- Whole monolithic app is divided into 3 main services: Person service, Connection service and Location service.
- Person service contains logic for Person route - retrieve_all(), retrieve() and create(), all of these function can be executed via REST API call.
- Connection service contains logic for Connection route - find_contacts().
- Location service is divided into 2 sub-service - location producer and location consumer.
    - location producer has a gRPC channel listening for data ingestion, which help reduce execution time and ensure data are ingested in correct format. 
      Then those info is pushed to kafka and will be stored in a topic. Kafka will be a good candidate when the location data are ingested massively.
    - location consumer will consume data in above mentioned kafka topic, process the received payload and ingest data into db.
